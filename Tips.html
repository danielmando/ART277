           <p>As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully<br>
            vaccinated might be feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still<br>

            margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" controls src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqFn6AHoJZQ"></embed><br>“‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19<br>
                vaccine series as recommended for the best protection against<br>
                severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No<br>
                vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give<br>
                you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of<br><br>
                being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.”</p><br><br>

                    others, including other vaccinated people?</font></h2><br>
                    <p>While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower<br>
                        rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune<br>
                        response to vaccines. </p><br>

                            disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines.<br>
                            We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these<br>
