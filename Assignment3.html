        <h2>Travelling in Depression</h2>
        <p>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought<br>
            me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has<br>
            given me a unique learning experience.</p>
            <p>At five, I <a href = "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/marvel"><font color ="blue">marveled</a></font> at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the<br>
                heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways<br>
                on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and<br>

thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in <br>

<p>It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first<br>
    became interested in language.</p>
    <p>It began with French, which taught me the importance of<br>
        pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris<br>
        where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it<br>
        PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on<br>
        the A, she looked at me bewildered.</p>
        <p>In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and<br>
            aware of its similarities with English through cognates.<br>
            Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks<br>
            different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to<br>
            me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates<br>
            come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.<a href = "https://www.google.com"><font color ="blue">Send Us Email</a></font> </p>
            <p>Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my<br>
                school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I<br>
                loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning<br>
                fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means<br>
                volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty<br>
                and rhythm as I form them.
